# Polygon Scan API Sample Project

This is a sample project I created to learn how to use the Polygon Scan API and to experiment with Python programming. Please note that this is not a complete API implementation project and it may not follow best practices or be optimized for production use.

## Project Description

In this project, I am using raw HTTP requests to query data from the Polygon network via the Polygon Scan API. I have included some sample code that demonstrates how to retrieve data from the API and parse the JSON response.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to learn more about the Polygon network and to practice using Python to interact with web APIs. I hope to use what I learn here to create more sophisticated projects in the future.

## Note on Project Configuration

Before executing the project, please follow these steps:

1. Copy **.env.template** to **.env**
2. Update **.env** by setting the desired endpoint URL (Mainnet or Testnet) and the value of your API key.
3. Make sure that your **.gitignore** file includes an entry for **.env** to prevent accidental check-in of your private security keys like API Key.

## Disclaimer

This project is provided as-is and is not intended for production use. Please be aware that there may be better and more secure ways to access the Polygon network and that this project may not be optimized for performance or scalability.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank the developers of the Polygon network and the Polygon Scan API for making this project possible. I would also like to thank the Python community for their excellent documentation and support.

## Future Work

Although this project is not a complete implementation of the Polygon Scan API, I hope to continue working on it and exploring more advanced features in the future. I also hope to experiment with other solutions for interacting with the Polygon network, such as web3.py or ethers.js.
